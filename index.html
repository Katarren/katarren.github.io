        <p>My name is Kiersten Taylor, and it seems you have come across my art website.</p>

        <h2>What kind of art I do </h2>

        <p>My medium of choice is digital.</p>

        <p>This incudes anything from digital concept art, to illustration, to animation.</p>

        <h3>What's available on this site</h3>

        <p>You might think that sounds pretty cool, or maybe not. You might just be asking: what's available on this site exactly?</p>

        <p>Well, I have included a tiny biography page, as well as a gallery for the art I have done. There's also a commissions page if you would like to get some of my art for yourself, as well as a way to contact me. Details will be under those pages.</p>
