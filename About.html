          <h1>About me</h1>
        </header>

        <p>This is a little bit about me and what I do. I know some people like to know about the artist, but if you are not one of those, feel free to skip this.</p>

        <h2>Basics</h2>

        <p>There is nothing in particular special about me; no tragic backstory like the artists of old.</p>

        <p>I grew up and currently reside in Michigan, USA.</p>

        <p>I am accepting of everyone and do not discriminate without reason. I am part of the LGBTQIA+ group myself, and go by any pronouns, though feminine pronouns are most common.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>After a typical public high school career, I went to Alma College to pursue a bachelors degree in art. I graduated in April of 2023. </p>

        <p>During my time at Alma College, I learned the typical mediums of sketching, painting, sculpting, and more. I loved it, but nothing stuck out as much as the digital work I was already doing before that.</p>

        <h2>About my art career</h2>

        <p>I did little commission work throughout college, my main focus being on the pieces I had to make for classes. I did a commission for a proessor though, which will be included in my gallery, along with the pieces I had during my final presentation before graduating.</p>

        <p>I did learn how to animate during my college career, something I am very proud of. So while I am new at animation, I am confident I will be improving as time goes on.</p>
